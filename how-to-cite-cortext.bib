	abstract = {Software is a fundamental pillar of modern scientific research, across all fields and disciplines. However, there is a lack of adequate means to cite and reference software due to the complexity of the problem in terms of authorship, roles, and credits. This complexity is further increased when it is considered over the lifetime of a software that can span up to several decades. Building upon the internal experience of Inria, the French research institute for digital sciences, we provide in this article a contribution to the ongoing efforts in order to develop proper guidelines and recommendations for software citation and reference. Namely, we recommend: first, a richer taxonomy for software contributions with a qualitative scale; second, to put humans at the heart of the evaluation; and third, to distinguish citation from reference.},

	abstract = {The Citation File Format (CFF) is a human- and machine-readable - and human-writable - format for CITATION files. These files provide citation metadata for (research and scientific) software. The format aims to support use cases for software citation described in [1]. CFF is serialized in YAML 1.2, and is therefore Unicode-based and cross-language (in terms of both natural language scripts and programming languages). This specification, together with the Unicode standard for characters, aims to provide all the information necessary to understand CFF, and to use (i.e., write) and re-use (i.e., read, validate, convert from) it. These specifications are maintained openly at https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format.   [1] A. M. Smith, D. S. Katz, K. E.

	abstract = {Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.},
